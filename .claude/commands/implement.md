# Implement Step

Implement step **$ARGUMENTS** from `implementation-plan.md`.

## Instructions

1. Read `implementation-plan.md` and find the step specified
2. Read `architecture.md` for technical context
3. Check what files already exist - don't recreate existing code
4. Implement all tasks in that step's checklist
5. Follow conventions in `CLAUDE.md`
6. After implementation, explain how to test the checkpoint

## Guidelines

- Create only the files needed for this step
- Import from existing `lib/` modules when available
- Use TypeScript with proper types
- Add brief comments only where logic isn't obvious
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## Output

After implementing:
1. List files created/modified
2. Explain what was built
3. Provide the checkpoint test instructions
